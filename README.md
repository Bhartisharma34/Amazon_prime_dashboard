**Unlocking the World of Amazon Prime Video**

Ever wondered what kind of content dominates Amazon Prime Video? Is it action-packed blockbusters, gripping documentaries, or classic sitcoms? As a data enthusiast, I wanted to find the answers. This project is my journey into the Amazon Prime Video dataset, where I've analyzed and visualized key trends to create a simple, yet insightful, dashboard.

**The Project: A Deep Dive into Prime's Library**

The goal was simple: to transform a raw dataset into meaningful insights. I started with a public dataset of Amazon Prime Video titles and, using the power of Python, cleaned the data, performed an exploratory data analysis, and finally, created a dashboard to visualize my findings. The dashboard provides a quick, at-a-glance view of the content available on the platform.

**What's Inside**

AmazonPrime_Dashboard.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook is the heart of the project. It documents every step of my data journey, from initial data cleaning to the analysis and generation of the final dashboard visualizations. It's fully commented so you can follow along with my process.
amazon_prime_titles.csv: This is the raw dataset I used for the analysis. It contains information on various movies and TV shows available on Amazon Prime.
Dashboard_Screenshot.png: This image provides a sneak peek of the final dashboard. It's a snapshot of the insights I've uncovered, such as the distribution of content by type and country, and the release year trends.

**Key Discoveries**

Through this analysis, I've been able to answer some intriguing questions about Amazon Prime's content:
Content Type: What's the balance between movies and TV shows?
Genre Trends: What are the most popular genres on the platform?
Geographic Focus: Which countries have the most titles?
Release Year Insights: How has the amount of content added to the platform changed over time?
These insights can be useful for anyone from a casual viewer trying to pick their next binge-watch to a content strategist looking at market trends.

**Tech Stack**

Python: The core language used for all data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: My go-to library for cleaning and transforming the dataset.
Jupyter Notebook: The perfect environment for a step-by-step data analysis workflow.
Power BI/Tableau (or similar): Used to create the final interactive dashboard based on the cleaned data. (This is a placeholder, you can change this to the tool you used).
